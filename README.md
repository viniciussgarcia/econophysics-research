Market prices analysis using tools from Statistical Physics. I am currently building a comparison between the density distribution of eigenvalues of the correlation matrix of a set of assets and the corresponding Marchenko-Pastur distribution. To compare, I am using as a metric of distance the Kullback-Leibler divergence. This metric will shown a measure of the randomness of the time series of prices.
